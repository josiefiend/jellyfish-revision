# jellyfish-revision
Code &amp; build instructions for second iteration of jellyfish, to be exhibited at Seattle Mini Maker Faire.

Jellyfish-rev is sensors and actuators as a single unit.
I ended up breaking my project into two modules (sensor and body) in order to work with my physical enclosure.
